Crisis Computing

## Minimum Delivery
- [ ] come up with **architecture** that beats performance of Olif2020

Which means: use more sopfisticated, better performing deep learning techniques than they.
(Images: VGG16, Text: CNN with 5 hidden layers)

## Extra
- [ ] semi-supervised labeling,
- [ ] contrastive learning,
- [ ] crisis embeddings (Crisis2Vec)

### Tasks

- [ ] Create "Clean" Version of CrisisMMD for comparision to the baselines in the papers -> Olif.
- [ ] Decide the Labels that we would like to focus on.
- [ ] Email and request access to Crisis2Vec embeddings
- [ ] Contrastive Learning for Images
- [ ] Find architecture to train for text classification/ text feature extraction.
- [ ] Semi-supervised text/tweet labeling
- [ ] Use Autoencoders to get features for image classification (?)
